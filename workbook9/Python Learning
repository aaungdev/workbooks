Hello,

I’d like to remind you that the SIAI action step below is due on August 30. This is an AMG-owned SIAI, and you are the only owner of this action step. Since the 30th falls on a Saturday, I just wanted to check if it will be ready to close on time.

Thank you!
I’ve completed adding each deliverable’s capacity in the following tabs: Submission, OMR, RAI, RMS, and MRM Tasks. I then combined all capacities by model and item type in the Work Driver tab. This will allow us to view the monthly capacity trend. However, the current version is based only on due dates and doesn’t reflect the actual time required to complete each deliverable.
