Hello,

I am reaching out regarding the status update of a new Tableau project. Back in April, I requested a new project, but I was unable to submit the level-4 manager attestation since we were temporarily on hold with Tableau and finalizing the work in Excel. Once that is completed, we plan to begin using the Tableau site.

At the time, I assumed the project had been cancelled because we could not submit the attestation on time. However, I recently received an access attestation for this site, even though I never had one previously.

Could you please clarify whether we already have an active Tableau site, or if not, what stage the project is currently in?

Thank you,
