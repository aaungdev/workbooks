Hands-On CPR & AED Training Brings Lifesaving Skills to GRM

On Wednesday, July 30, GRM hosted a hands-on CPR (Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation) and AED (Automated External Defibrillator) training session. The two-hour course was led by Freddie Burgos, with support from Charles Chouinard and LaShaun Smalls. It was an interactive and practical session where participants learned how to perform CPR, operate an AED, and respond to choking emergencies for both adults and infants.

The training gave participants a solid foundation in lifesaving techniques and helped build confidence to respond in real-world emergencies. A big thank you to our instructors for leading such an engaging and valuable sessionâ€”and to everyone who joined in with focus and enthusiasm.
