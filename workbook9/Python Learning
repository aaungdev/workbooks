Dear [HR’s Name],

I know you’re out of the office, so no urgency—please reply when you’re available.

I wanted to reach out to get your insights on an internal transfer. 

As you may know, I completed a Software Development program through Year Up and have been working as a Business Support Lead. Since I’m approaching one year in my current role, my goal is to transition into a Software Engineer position.

I would really appreciate any guidance you can share or if you could point me toward internal openings in this area.

Thank you so much for your help!

Best regards,
