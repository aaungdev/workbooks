It was a nice meeting with you. I got a lot of energy from our conversation. I’m really impressed by your journey at Bank of America — it’s longer than my age :)

I found the Employee Networks leader page. I’ll filter for Jersey City and connect with some individuals. Thanks for the resource — I’ll use it and keep in touch with you.
