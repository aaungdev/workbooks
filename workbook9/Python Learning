I hope you’re doing well! I got your contact from Marie and wanted to reach out to connect for some guidance on an internal transfer.

I’m a Year Up Software Development program graduate and have been working as a Business Support Lead. As I approach one year in my current team, my goal is to transition into a Software Engineer role, and I’d really appreciate any advice or direction you can share.

Thank you so much!
