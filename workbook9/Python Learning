Hello [Name],

I hope you’re feeling better soon. Please feel free to respond whenever it’s convenient for you.

My name is Aung, and I’m new to both the bank and the Jersey City area. I came across your profile through the Employee Networks page and wanted to reach out. I’d love to learn more about your journey and would also be open to getting involved in any volunteer opportunities.

If you’re open to it, may I set up a time to connect?

Best regards,
