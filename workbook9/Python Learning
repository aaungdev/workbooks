I hope you’re doing well! As you may remember, I connected with you last December during my internship. Since then, I’ve been working as a Business Support Lead.

As I approach one year in my current role, I’m looking to transition into a Software Engineer position. I wanted to check if there are any open software engineer roles on your team and learn more about the requirements.

Thanks so much for your time and help!

Best,
