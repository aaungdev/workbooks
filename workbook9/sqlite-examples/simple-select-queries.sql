First, I’d like to walk you through the calculation steps I plan to take. Second, I want to highlight some challenges I’m facing with the Excel file. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or an alternative approach.

Calculation Steps & Logic:
	1.	Sum of Capacity Values:
Sum the values from the Capacity tab where the Summary column matches “RAI”, “OM”, or “BAU”, and the Year is “2025”, for a specific model. ✅ (Completed)
	2.	Combine Work Driver Totals:
Aggregate the weighted totals of OMR, RAI, MRM tasks, and RMs from the Work Driver tab.
	3.	Total Capacity for a Model’s Work:
Divide the weighted total (from step 2) by the total capacity.
	4.	Capacity by Item Type:
Multiply each Item Type’s value by the result from step 3.

Challenge:

The issue arises in step 2 — the Work Driver tab contains only formulas. Excel doesn’t allow recalculating an already calculated result directly within a formula.

One workaround is to copy and paste the Work Driver tab as values (without formatting) into a new tab and perform the calculations there. However, if I try to calculate everything directly using formulas without referencing any tab, Excel cannot handle the complexity.

So far, the best solution seems to be pasting all calculated results into one tab before applying further logic.

Just checking with you — do you have any alternative suggestions or a more efficient approach?
